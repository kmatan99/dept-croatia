Things to implement:

    - Better structured and more detailed Logging (preferrably using a Middleware)
    
    - Robust Exception Handling
        - Basic exception handling is in place but lacks depth.
        - Specific exception types
    
    - Strict Input Validation
        - Input validation is currently minimal or not comprehensive.

    - Specific Movie detail/info page endpoint
